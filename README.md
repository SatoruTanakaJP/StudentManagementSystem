# 🎓 Student Management System (Java Swing)

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **Java Swing-based graphical student management system** developed as part of a university programming assignment.  
It allows administrators to manage student data through a user-friendly interface, supporting features such as adding, viewing, and deleting student records.  
The program demonstrates an understanding of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **event-driven GUI design**, and **modular code structure** using multiple classes.

## ⚙️ Features
- Add, view, and delete student records  
- Display student information in a table view  
- Clear input fields with a single button  
- Modular design separating logic and interface (AdminUI, Student, StudentManagement)  
- Responsive and intuitive Java Swing interface

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Code is structured into reusable classes: `Student`, `StudentManagement`, and `AdminUI` |
| **Swing GUI Components** | Implements `JFrame`, `JButton`, `JLabel`, `JTextField`, and `JTable` for UI design |
| **Event Handling** | Uses `ActionListener` to handle user input and button interactions |
| **Collections** | Uses lists or arrays to store and manage student data dynamically |
| **Encapsulation** | Data is managed securely through class fields and getter/setter methods |

## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Make sure all three files are in the same directory:  
AdminUI.java
Student.java
StudentManagement.java


2️⃣ Open a terminal or VS Code terminal in that directory.  
3️⃣ Compile all Java files:  
```bash
javac *.java
```
4️⃣ Run the program (AdminUI is the main class):
```bash
java AdminUI
```

## 🏫 Educational Context

This project was created as part of a Computer Science course at the University of the People.
It demonstrates the use of Java Swing for GUI development, modular architecture, and OOP principles in an educational management context.
